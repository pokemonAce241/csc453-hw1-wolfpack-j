# CSC 453 - Homework 1 - Wolfpack J

*All of the code was written using Python 3.  If the code is not running correctly, then make sure that you are using Python 3.  If Python 3 is not your default Python installation, then you will need to use the `pip3` command instead of `pip` and the `python3` command instead of `python`.*

All of the code used in these files requires that the Python Paho MQTT client library is installed.  You can install the library by following the steps below:
1. Run `pip install paho-mqtt`.

For a more detailed explanation on how to do this see [http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/into-mqtt-python-client/](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/into-mqtt-python-client/).
